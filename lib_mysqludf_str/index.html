<p>MySQL already includes many string functions natively. However, this function repository is not exhaustive and other string functions can ease the development of MySQL-based applications. Users coming from PHP or Perl background, for instance, may expect to find their entire set of string functions in MySQL. lib_mysqludf_str aims to offer a library of string functions which can complement the native one.</p>
